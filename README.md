# projectable

![screenshot](./extras/screenshot.png)

`projectable` is a highly configurable project manager. You can do everything
your project needs from a comfortable and smooth interface: run commands, open
your editor, integrate with tmux, see git changes, and more.

Instead of exploring the depths of your most nested directory, open a file simply
from the `projectable` file listing!

Here are just a few builtin things projectable can do:

- Preview files
- Run commands, foreground or background
- Fuzzy search files
- Create files or directories
- Delete files or directories
- Ignore files based on glob patterns
- Toggle hidden files
- Mark files to quick and easy access
- Respect gitignore
- Live update to new files/changes
- View your project as a hierarchy
- Automatically recognize project root, with customizability
- Run special commands that change on a per-file basis
- View git changes
- Easily write custom commands
- Fully configurable with a dead-simple `toml` file

## Getting Started

To get started, you can use one of the following installation methods:

<details>
<summary>cargo</summary>
<br>
```bash
$ cargo install projectable
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Build from source</summary>
<br>
Requires [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) to be installed on your
computer.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dzfrias/projectable
$ cd projectable
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/prj
```
</details>

After you've installed, run `prj` to start it up! The default keybinds are
vim-like (j for up, k for down), but you can change them in
[CONFIG.md](./extras/CONFIG.md).

## Keybinds

Here a list of the available actions and their default bindings. For
